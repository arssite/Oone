# 0one

Welcome to **0one** – a binary bit game where computation and strategy combine! The game involves 0s and 1s, and your goal is to outwit the ARS Bot to make the majority results 1. 
How It Works:

Objective: The game presents a 3x3 grid where users and an agent take turns clicking on buttons. Each button represents a bit (0 or 1). The goal is to fill the grid with these bits and observe how bitwise operations are applied to compute results based on the selected bits.

Gameplay Mechanics:

User Turn: Players click on grid buttons to set their values (0 or 1). The grid updates based on user interactions.
Agent Turn: After the user’s turn, the game automatically simulates moves by the agent, which also involves setting bits in the grid.
Bitwise Operations: As bits are set, the game calculates results using bitwise operations such as AND (&) and OR (|). These results are displayed in specific grid locations.
Winning Condition: The game evaluates the results of the bitwise operations. If the results meet certain conditions, the game declares a winner (User or Agent).
Educational Benefits:

Understanding Truth Tables: The game visually demonstrates how different combinations of bits (0s and 1s) affect the results of bitwise operations. By interacting with the grid and observing the outcomes, users can see how truth tables are constructed and used.

Hands-On Bitwise Operations: Players learn the practical application of bitwise operations. For example, they can see how the AND operation requires both bits to be 1 for the result to be 1, while the OR operation requires at least one bit to be 1.

Interactive Learning: The game provides an interactive way to explore bitwise logic. Players get immediate feedback on their actions, which helps reinforce their understanding of how bitwise operations influence binary data.

Reinforcing Binary Concepts: By repeatedly setting and evaluating bits, users strengthen their grasp of binary numbers and logical operations, which are fundamental concepts in computer science and digital electronics.

### Game Rules

1. **Turn Sequence**: You and the ARS Bot take turns alternatively.
   
2. **Starting Bit**: The game starts with Bit 1. You have the first move.

3. **Free Bit Spaces**: 
   - You can use free bit spaces during the 0 bit turn.
   - Free bit spaces do not affect the results directly.

4. **Operations**:
   - **Horizontal Operation**: Perform an AND operation on horizontal pairs of buttons.
   - **Vertical Operation**: Perform an OR operation on vertical pairs of buttons.

5. **Winning Condition**: 
   - You need to make the majority of results 1 to win against the ARS Bot.

### Game Guidelines

1. **Objective**: Beat the ARS Bot by making the majority of results 1.
2. **Bit Use**: 
   - Start with Bit 1.
   - For Bit 0 turns, use free bit space if needed.
3. **Strategy**:
   - Utilize horizontal AND operations and vertical OR operations strategically to achieve your goal.
